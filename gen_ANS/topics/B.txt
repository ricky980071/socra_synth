Certainly, let me provide a summary conclusion for each of the five topics:

1. **Quality of Education:**

4. **Balance of Degrees and Skills:**
   - Agent-A supports the shift from degrees to skills, emphasizing stakeholder engagement and sustained commitment.

Ongoing dialogue and collaboration are crucial for the effective and well-rounded implementation of educational expansion.
